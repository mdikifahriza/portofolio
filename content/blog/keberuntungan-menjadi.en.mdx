# The Fortune of Being  
_An Existential Reflection on Being and Human Dignity_

---

Once, I did not exist.  
Now, I am in the world.  
Is this mere coincidence,  
Or a fortune rich in meaning?

> Existence is not just life,  
> But the opportunity to become—  
> To feel, to think, to love—  
> A gift unknown to nothingness.

## From Non-Existence to Being

**Existence is not merely a fact,  
It is a value.**  
In Sartre’s existentialism,  
Existence precedes essence—  
We shape ourselves,  
Not defined from the start.

Nothingness is silence and void.  
No sensation, no potential.  
But in being,  
All possibilities are born.

## Awareness and Dignity

We know we are alive,  
And we know we will cease.  
That is why the human is _Dasein_—  
A being who questions its own being.  
Unlike rocks or beasts,  
Humans have will, ethics, and dignity.

Kant said:  
> "Man must be treated as an end,  
> Not merely as a means."

For humans possess reason and morality.  
We can choose,  
And thus are responsible.

## Why Be Human?

Animals live. Objects exist.  
But only humans are aware of their being.  
We resist death,  
We cling to life,  
Because life holds value,  
And humanity carries its highest potential.

## Existential Fortune

To be human  
Is not simply to be born,  
But to awaken to the truth:

- We can understand life,  
- Compose ethics,  
- Love and forgive,  
- Question God and time,  
- And choose meaning.

That is the true fortune:  
**Not just to live, but to know that we are alive.**

## Conclusion

Before I was, I was not.  
Now I am—a human being.  
Not a beast, not a stone.  
And so I carry a responsibility:  
To become,  
To seek meaning,  
To be grateful.
